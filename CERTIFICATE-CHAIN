Steps to start a certificate chain from scratch
===============================================

The example uses one trust root, and two site keys

1. generate root key
   root> ndnsec-keygen /root | tee root.ndncert | ndnsec-cert-install -

2. generate site keys, and certificates
   site1> ndnsec-keygen /root/site1 > site1.req
   (copy site1.req to root machine)
   root> ndnsec-certgen -N /root/site1 -s /root site1.req > site1.ndncert
   (copy site1.ndncert to site1 machine)
   site1> cat site1.ndncert | ndnsec-cert-install -

   (similar for site2)

3. generate routers' keys (NLSR example, could be users)
   router1> ndnsec-keygen /root/site1/router1 > router1.req
   (copy router1.req to site1 machine)
   site1> ndnsec-certgen -N /root/site1/router1 -s /root/site1 router1.req > router1.ndncert
   (copy router1.ndncert to router1 machine)
   router1> cat router1.ndncert | ndnsec-cert-install -

   (similar for router2)

4. repo-ng or ndns as platform for key storage, can be replaced by a simple app (publishing keys)
   (copy *.ndncert to some connected machine on the network, and publish them from repo-ng or ndns)
